# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Figma MCP + Claude Sonnet 4

Project in progress with Figma MCP + Claude Sonnet 4

## Notes for Claude Sonnet 4
- Use React + Tailwind CSS for frontend implementation, initialized with Vite.
- Use normalize.css from https://cdnjs.com/libraries/normalize
- Terminal commands I'll do by myself, dont propose me to run them by you, just write them to me and end your message. Use pnpm.
- Dont start next task, when you check current task - finish you answer and wait for next command.
- Follow modular component structure (Header, Footer, Sections, Cards, etc.).
- Use provided image constants for assets.
- Ensure adaptive/responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities for breakpoints.
- Organize code into components, utils, and styles directories as needed.
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11.
- Utility styles are handled via Tailwind v4's new approach, not the config file.
- Ignore @apply error in src/index.css, thats how tailwindcss v4 works.
